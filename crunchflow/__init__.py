"""
The core package for working with CrunchFlow input and output files.

The ``crunchflow`` package provides tools to read, write, and manipulate
input files to CrunchFlow, as well as to load and visualize output files.
It is organized into two main subpackages:

- ``crunchflow.input``: Create, modify, or parse CrunchFlow input files using
  Python classes that mirror CrunchFlow's keyword-block structure.
- ``crunchflow.output``: Load, analyze, and plot simulation results from
  ``time_series`` and ``spatial_profile`` output files.

For an overview of usage, see the tutorials linked in the documentation homepage.
