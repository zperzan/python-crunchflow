"""The `crunchflow.output` subpackage provides tools for loading, parsing, and
analyzing output files generated by CrunchFlow and CrunchTope simulations.

It includes specialized classes for handling:
    - Spatial profiles of variables at different output times, with support for
      2D/3D gridded visualization (`SpatialProfile`)
    - Time series data extracted at specific cells in the model domain
      (`TimeSeries`)
    - Main output files containing speciation data for each geochemical condition
      (`MainOutputFile`, `Speciation`)

These modules enable users to extract numerical results, plot chemical
concentrations and spatial gradients, and integrate CrunchFlow output into custom
Python workflows for postprocessing, visualization, and model diagnostics.
