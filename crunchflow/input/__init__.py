"""The `crunchflow.input` subpackage provides tools for reading, writing, and modifying
CrunchFlow input files using Python classes that mirror the structure of these files.

CrunchFlow input files are divided into keyword blocks (e.g., `RUNTIME`, `FLOW`, `TRANSPORT`,
`CONDITION`), each of which controls a specific aspect of the simulation setup. This
subpackage offers Python representations for each of these blocks and supports programmatic
workflows for creating or editing `.in` files.

Some notable features include:
    - The `InputFile` class represents an entire CrunchFlow input file, with one attribute
      per block (e.g., `.runtime`, `.flow`, `.output`, etc.).
    - Each block is implemented as a dedicated class (e.g., `Flow`, `Transport`,
      `Condition`) and inherits from a shared `KeywordBlock` base class.
    - Input files can be generated from scratch, modified in memory, or parsed from existing
      files.

Most blocks in a CrunchFlow input file correspond directly to attributes of the `InputFile`
class. For example, the `FLOW` block is accessible via `InputFile.flow`, and the `RUNTIME`
block via `InputFile.runtime`. Similarly, most keywords within a block (e.g., `calculate_flow`,
`time_units`, or `permeability_x`) are represented as attributes of that blockâ€™s class. For
example, `InputFile.flow.calculate_flow` or `InputFile.runtime.time_units`.

Two notable exceptions to this structure are:
    - **Conditions**: Because multiple `CONDITION` blocks can be defined in a single input file,
      they are stored as a dictionary in `InputFile.conditions`, with each key representing the
      name of a different condition.
    - **Species in Conditions**: Within a `CONDITION` block, any number of species can be specified,
      with arbitrary names (e.g., `Na+`, `Cl-`, `HCO3-`). These are stored as key-value pairs in the
      `concentrations` dictionary of the `Condition` object, rather than as fixed attributes.
